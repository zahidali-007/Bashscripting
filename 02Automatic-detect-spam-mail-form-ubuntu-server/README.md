 This script installs SpamAssassin, configures it to mark emails as spam if they have a score of 5 or higher,<br>
 creates a folder for spam emails, sets up a procmail script to move spam emails to the spam folder,<br>
 runs sa-learn to train SpamAssassin on the spam folder, sets up a cron job to run the procmail script every hour, and restarts SpamAssassin to apply the changes.<br>
